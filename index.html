                            Plant your hydrangea outdoors
                            Hydrangea plants are hardy and disease-resistant for the most part,
                            though they can be infected with mildew if planted in areas that are shady 
                            and humid,. For best conditions, plant them in a sunny spot and offer plenty
                                of water. The hues can change depending on the type of soil 
                            the flowering plants are put in. For example, pink hydrangeas will 
                            turn blue when planted in acidic soil</p>
